# Conquer the Dungeon
This is a game made using the Greenfoot engine for ICS4U, developed by
* Freeman Wang (tilemap system, pathfinding, room design)
* Tony Lin (animaion, art)
* Osmond Lin (enemy AI)
* Ivan Xie (Music & sound)
* Neelan Thurairajah (UI & tile behaviour)

## Getting the Game
To play this, you would need to [install Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/download) through the given link. It doesn't matter how you installed it, as long as it's there.\
You know, the standard procedure like any other software.

Next, you have to clone this repo (or get its source code).

I guess you can go to your terminal, navigate somewhere where you want to clone to, and run
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/kingmclol/SoulKnightsICS4U.git
```
and probably, it would work. If I didn't make a typo there.

Or, you can use the green button that says `<>Code` at the top-right and just take a zip file of the code and extract it somewhere.

Anyway, once you've got the code, you can run Greenfoot and open the EcosystemSimulator folder from there, and you should be able to play now.

##
In this game, you play as a lucky person who is reincarnated into a world that is solely dedicated to fighting in an never-ending dungeon. Don't think about why you were placed specifically in this world, otherwise you'll get sniped by a nearby skeleton.

Descend lower and lower, clearing increasingly difficult rooms while getting slightly stronger along the way.

How far can you get before you need to be reincarnated once again?

## Instructions
- `WASD` movement.
- Click to attack.
- `R` to switch weapon.
- `SHIFT` to dash.
- `Q` to use ultimate.
- Keep your HP above zero while making your enemies' HP zero.
